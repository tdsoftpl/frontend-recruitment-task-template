# TDSOFT Junior Frontend Developer Recruitment Task

This recruitment assignment is designed to test your React knowledge and ability to complete a given task by adding new features to the "real", existing codebase. This application uses CSS-in-JS for styling and the React-context API for state management.

You have about 7 days to complete the recruitment task (counting from the date of receipt of the e-mail with the details). This is your unique instance of the recruitment task, please apply your solution directly here. There is no need to fork it anywhere. A recruiter from TDSOFT will check it right after the specified time.

Imagine the current application you see on the right (in the "Browser" tab) as the first version of the "Rick & Morty widget" - a dead simple widget showing some basic data about characters from the show.

As a Junior Frontend Developer, your task is to create version 2 of this very widget. You have received the Figma project file and some work including rendering Rick Sanchez's information has already been done.

# The Task 👨‍💻

- Make a pixel-perfect match with new designs and pick required values from the Rick & Morty API

- Integrate the "Previous" and "Next" buttons. Once clicked they should fetch and render previous (-1) or next (+1) characters from the Rick & Morty API

- Integrate "Alive" / "Dead" / "unknown" variants. They should be based on the "status" field from the API

- The "episodes" label value should be computed (sum) from the "episode" field from the API

...in case you wonder - yes, you can refactor everything as you wish, we want to have a product that meets the criteria but it's also well written. This sandbox is entirely yours - do your magic 🪄

## Resources 📚

- Figma project file: https://www.figma.com/file/HYf7stAEUjneRXpgG8xVL0/Rick-and-Morty-Widget

## Bonus points 💯

here are some things you can do if you feel like 😇 (but these are not obligatory). You can still impress us by doing a bare minimum 👍

- Protect the app from fetching characters ids that are out of range (non-existing) (Tip: The range of character identifiers is specified in the documentation: https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#character)
- Re-using colors declarations (possibly with a constant/enum or even with "theming")
- Introduce the "loading state" as designed: https://www.figma.com/file/HYf7stAEUjneRXpgG8xVL0/Rick-and-Morty-Widget?node-id=2%3A76
- Handle possible network / API errors with the "error state" as designed: https://www.figma.com/file/HYf7stAEUjneRXpgG8xVL0/Rick-and-Morty-Widget?node-id=2%3A101
